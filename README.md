# Conclusion to Full-Stack Development

## Learning Goals

- Use React and Flask together to build beautiful and powerful web applications.
- Organize client and server code so that it is easy to understand and maintain.
- Create websocket connections between clients and servers to improve our
  applications' performance.

## Key Vocab

- **Full-Stack Development**: development of a frontend and a backend for an
  application. True full-stack development includes a database, a logic/server
  layer, and a frontend built in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Backend**: the layer of a full-stack application that handles business logic
  and other programmatic tasks that users do not or should not see. Can be
  written in many languages, including Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and more.
- **Frontend**: the layer of a full-stack application that users see and
  interact with. It is always written in the frontend languages: JavaScript,
  HTML, and CSS. (_There are others now, but they are based on these three._)
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: a method for a server to indicate
  any ports (or other identifiers) for servers that can share its resources.
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: a protocol that defines how computers
  send data to each other. A connection is formed and stays active until the
  applications on either end have finished sending data to one another.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: a stateless protocol where
  applications communicate for the length of time that it takes for data to be
  transferred.
- **WebSocket**: a protocol that allows clients and servers to communicate with
  one another in both directions. The bidirectional nature of websocket
  communication allows a connected state to be generated and the connection
  maintained until it is terminated by one side. This allows for speedy and
  seamless connections between frontends and backends.

## Conclusion

Most of your experience with web applications is with their _frontends_. The
posts on Reddit, the scrolling thumbnails on Netflix, the map and tiny moving
cars on Lyft- all of these are designed with JavaScript. It can be frustrating
sometimes when learning backend languages and frameworks to know that the
JavaScript is what everyone is seeing and interacting with.

That being said, none of these applications would do very much without a
backend- specifically, in the case of Reddit, Netflix, and Lyft, they would not
do very much without Flask.

Full-stack development gives software engineers the ability to design
applications that do as much as they possibly can. They can be as visually
appealing as Airbnb and as powerful as AWS (if you have the DS&A know-how).
Use of ORMs and clever implementation of concepts like REST and WebSocket will
expand the possibilities for your career even further.

In the next module, you will learn how to deploy your full-stack applications
to the internet.
